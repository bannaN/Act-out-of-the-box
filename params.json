{"name":"Act-out-of-the-box","tagline":"Start hacking on Act-Voyager out of the box, using Vagrant and Virtualbox","body":"Act out of the box\r\n==================\r\n\r\nIn the final stage, as described at hacking on Act will start as simple as:\r\n\r\n    git clone https:/github.com/Act-Voyager/Act-out-of-the-box.git\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    vagrant ssh\r\n\r\nFor more details, see the seven-step instructions below.\r\n\r\nHow to contribute\r\n=================\r\n\r\nContributions are more than welcome at any time!\r\n\r\nThere are some issues that will show up but it seems we can work arround them,\r\nbut it would be better if those were not there in the firstplace. Please go to\r\nhttps://github.com/Act-Voyager/Act-out-of-the-box/issues for any troubles and\r\ncommit your changes.\r\n\r\nFor any suggestions or issues concerning the base install of the box, visit\r\nthe repository on: https://github.com/THEMA-MEDIA/Act-out-of-the-box\r\n\r\nAbout the repository\r\n====================\r\n\r\nThis Vagrant Bootloading script installs the following:\r\n\r\n* Act Voyager\r\n* Apache httpd config\r\n* A $HOME/voyager event directory\r\n\r\nSetup / Installation\r\n====================\r\n\r\n0) Install VirtualBox and Vagrant, visit the following websites to download\r\n   your specific OS installers:\r\n\r\n   * https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\r\n   * https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html\r\n\r\n   Or on Ubunto, run\r\n\r\n    $ apt-get install vagrant virtualbox\r\n\r\n1) Clone Act-out-of-the-box Vagrant File from your favourite github account to\r\n   your work directory on your host system. (Optionally, consider forking\r\n   the project on github and clone that one instead.)\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/Act-Voyager/Act-out-of-the-box.git\r\n\r\n3) Optionally, edit the Vagrantfile field for config.vm.network ip\r\n   address to suit your needs. By default, the VM is set up to use DHCP\r\n   to get an IP address. You can override this by uncommenting the\r\n   following line in Vagrantfile:\r\n\r\n    config.vm.network: \"private_network\", ip: \"192.168.42.42\"\r\n\r\n5) Run \"vagrant up\". This downloads the required image and set up\r\n   your Act instance.\r\n\r\n    $ vagrant up\r\n\r\n6) Log into the VM to start Act setup process\r\n\r\n    $ vagrant ssh\r\n\r\n7) Start hacking!\r\n\r\nVagrantFile\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis VagrantFile mainly does the final install of Act, more specific,\r\nAct-Voyager. \r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n============\r\n\r\n* cpanm fails the first time, possibly due to an Unicode charater in the name\r\n  of the Author: 'Ã‰ric Cholet'\r\n\r\n* domain name for Apache is not qualified\r\n\r\n* missing setup\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n================\r\n\r\nThanks to Alex Muntada, Detlev Hauschildt for install clarifications\r\non Act itself. The original documentation might need some polishing.\r\n\r\nThanks for Salve J. Nilsen for checking and editing where needed\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright & License\r\n===================\r\n\r\n(c) 2014 THEMA-MEDIA Th.J. van Hoesel\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
